# audibly
An easy to use and powerful Web Audio API OO wrapper for controlling audio on the web.

> The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning)  and much more.

audibly looks to take all the wonderfullness that the Web Audio API offers and abstract it into a more intuitive and user friendly API.
